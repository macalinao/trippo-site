          <h2>Back to back trip itinerary</h2>
          <p>Have you ever though, <em>Oh man oh man, not again</em> while planning? Trippo decides where to go at your destination so you can spend less time planning and more time doing.</p>
          <p>We use information about activities from Expedia and pipe it through IBM Watson to determine how well an activity matches with your personality.</p>

          <h2>Ever since you left your city</h2>
          <p>We know that navigation has a reputation for being annoying if you're not familiar with the city. Using the ESRI api, we have maps to let you know where to go.</p>
